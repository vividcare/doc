## Potential solution

A cloud-based health information software, a solution to meet people's electronic health records, telehealth, and more. This solution will put patients in control of their health, by collecting and digitizing their medical records into an electronic portable timeline. With this solution, patients can achieve the following:

* See their entire health history at a glance
* Share their entire health history with their doctor/medical practitioner
* Doctors/medical practitioners can hook up with patients to update/send in their health records using their unique ID
* Download their entire health history as a PDF
* Add family/ friends to their profile in terms of emergency 

## What will be the biggest win of this solution?

This solution will help patients to easily access their medical records and gives them the opportunity to contribute data to medical research.

## Why are we solving this problem now?

Medical information explosion is a problem in the health sector. Not only do we Nigerians not have a healthy database, most hospitals still depend on the paper data management culture. People will travel, and meet with new doctors, with their health record/history been available and accessible, lives will be saved from improper medications and in time of emergency.
